# Design patterns with TypeScript

## Creational patterns

- <b>Singleton</b> - only a single instance can exist.
- <b>Builder</b> - builds a complex object using simple objects and using a step by step approach.
- <b>Prototype</b> - generates new objects using a prototypical instance copy.
- <b>Factory Method</b> - defines an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate
- <b>Abstract Factory</b> - provides an interface to create object families related or dependencies without specify yours concrete classes;.

## Structural patterns

- <b>Composite</b> - the intent of a composite is to “compose” objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
- <b>Adapter</b> - the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
- <b>Bridge</b> -  allows you to separate the abstraction from the implementation.
- <b>Decorator</b> - allows behavior to be added to an individual object, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.
- <b>Facade</b> - provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.
- <b>Proxy</b> - lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object.
- <b>Flyweight</b> - minimizes memory usage by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects.

## Behavioral patterns

- <b>Strategy</b> - enables selecting an algorithm at runtime.
- <b>Command</b> - used to encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time.
- <b>Memento</b> - saves and restores the previous state of an object without revealing the details of its implementation.
- <b>State</b> - allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state change.
- <b>Mediator</b> - defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
- <b>Chain of Responsibility</b> - Gives more than one object a chance to handle the request.
- <b>Template method</b> - lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.
- <b>Observer</b>
- <b>Iterator</b>
- <b>Visitor</b>

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm init -y`

Start a new Node project

### `npm i typescript -D`

Install typeScript

### `npm i -D ts-node`

Run typeScript code
